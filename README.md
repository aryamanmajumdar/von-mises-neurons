# von-mises-neurons
Simulates population codes of von-mises neurons to different contrast and orientation inputs.

Part1a assumes that there exists no correlated noise across the neurons, making deciphering of
stimulus simpler.
Part1b and subsequent parts take into account correlated noise.

The two figures below show various weight vectors defining the various population responses for various differences in the stimulus orientation. The first figure is the output without noise. The second, with noise.
